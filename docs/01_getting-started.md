# Getting Started: Designing your Course

For general information about course design we recommend to look at the suggestions of the [MOOC Canvas Framework](http://mooccanvas.com/use.html).

Another great resource is the [MOOC Design Patterns Project](http://www.moocdesign.cde.london.ac.uk/), particularly, their set of [design pattern cards](http://www.moocdesign.cde.london.ac.uk/outputs/design-pattern-cards).

## Introduction: 

You have decided that you want to offer educational resources or need training for a large number of people. How do you do that? How to MOOC?

From our own experience we recommend the following:

## Course Design

 -	Define your **target audience**: do you want to address your employees or the open public? A general or specialist audience? Should your course be of academic nature or focus on practical aspects? Do you aim at a specific age group, e.g. pupils, professionals, silver surfers?

 - Define the **learning outcomes**:  which competences should the learner acquire by taking the MOOC? Are you introducing a new technology, product or service? Do you need to apply new compliance guidelines? Do you want to improve IT skills? Do you want to give a digital university lecture?

 - Build your **course team**: you will need content experts for content preparation, lecturers, teaching assistants for course support, a course manager for operational aspects and technical staff for content production.

 - Set up **time frame and course schedule**: when should your course start? What is the course duration? How much effort per week do you expect from the participants?

 - Design your **course content**: create a syllabus, prepare slides for video lectures, design questions for self-tests and assignments, compile further readings and build hands-on exercises.

 - **Copyrights and Licensing**: clarify copyrights of used 3rd-party material, decide on copyright attribution of course content.
