# Nutshell

These are very short courses that introduce a topic aimed at beginners to explain specific concepts based on the respective topics covered in the course to further motivate participants on taking related courses.  

Generally, these courses have a duration of **2 weeks**, determined by the deadlines of the offered graded assignments.
Depending on the type of the course, graded assignments might be offered or not. 

The duration of the course is basically defined by the deadlines of assignemnts and exercises. The course material itself is generally available in self-paced mode after the deadlines have passed. During the runtime of the course, the course forum is open for discussions among the participants and support by the teaching team. 

If the course offers graded assignments, **Records of Achievement** can be earned during the runtime of the course. **Confirmations of Participation** can be earned during the course runtime and also in self-paced mode. **Certificates** are not offered in Nutshell-courses.
