# Self-paced

Participants can learn at their own pace and comfort. 

There are two types of self-paced courses.

1. courses that were event-based at a certain point of time in the past (e.g. the archived courses on openHPI).
2. courses that were intended to be self-paced from the start. 

Obviously, self-paced courses cannot have deadlines for exercises or exams.
To hide the results from graded exercises or exams until all participants have solved them, however, deadlines are required,
Therefore, self-paced courses of type 1 used to have graded exercises or exams but the deadlines for those already have passed; self-paced courses of type 2 should not offer graded exercises or exams at all, hence, no Records of Achievement are awarded.

We recommend, however, to, nevertheless, offer ungraded exercises and exams to provide an interactive course experience.
We also recommend to offer a Confirmation of Participation as this often is expected by the participants. 

In self-paced courses of type 1, we recommend to close the discussion forum about a week or two after the course has ended. This includes closing the forums in the Collab Spaces.
In self-paced courses of type 2, the forum should be closed from the start. The same applies, in most cases, for the Collab Spaces.
Closing the forum means setting it to read-only mode.

The reason for this is, that we expect at least a minimal amount of forum monitoring, when forum discussions are enabled.
