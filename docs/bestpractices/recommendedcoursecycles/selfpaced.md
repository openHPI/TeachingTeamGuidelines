# Self-paced

These are the courses that participants can learn at their own pace and comfort. There are no graded tests and assignments in this type of course, hence, no certificates are awarded. However, for some self-paced courses, ungraded assignments or self-tests might be available, so, for those specific courses, a Confirmation of Participation might be awarded. These courses do not offer any Collab spaces or forum support but if the density of participants are higher, some sort of forum post acknowledgement or support might be provided. All the archived courses on openHPI falls under this type of course.  

Course administrators are advised to not set any course as self-paced that contains graded assignments or tests.
