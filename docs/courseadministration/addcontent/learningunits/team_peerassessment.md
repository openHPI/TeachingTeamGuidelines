A team peer assessment only differs from a regular peer assessment in the following setting:

**As team assessment:**  Use this option to enable team peer assessment.  


### Team Evaluation Rubrics  
Additionally, you have to add rubrics for the evalution of the team members within the team.

We recommend to add the following rubrics:
- Contribution (to the task's solution)
- Organisation
- Social Skills

Rubric options do not have to be assigned to these rubrics. 
The team members will always be able to rate their team mates in a 3-star rating system.
