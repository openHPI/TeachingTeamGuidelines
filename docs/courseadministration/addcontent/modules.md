# Adding Modules

It is advisable to keep the surface of the course website clean and comprehensible for the learners.

## Course Structure

Each course consists of several modules or sections. In general these modules comprise 1 week of the course. They can, however, have arbitrary names and are not necessarily restricted to last exactly 1 week. A typical 6 week course structure could look like this:
- Welcome (Optional, may also be included in Week 1)
  - Survey (Optional)
- Week 1
- Week 2
- Week 3
- Week 4
- Excursion
- Week 5
- Week 6
- Final Exam
- Survey (I like, I wish)

The platform team will create the course for you. Fill it with your content.

**Title:** Could be something like Week 1, Excursion, or Final Exam. This will be visible for the user in the course's left hand navigation bar, the course syllabus, and the course content list on the course detail page.

**Description:** A short description of the section's content within one or two sentences. This will be visible for the user in the course syllabus, and the course content list on the course detail page.

**Published:** If the section is not published it will not be visible for the users at all.

**Start date:** Before the start date the section will be "greyed out" and locked for the users.

**End date:** Usually, an end date is not set for a section. Only use this if you have a well defined purpose or intention.

**Close discussions:** Discussions can be left open for 2 more weeks after the completion of the course. Later it can be closed for certain sections, if required. After closing, it is no longer possible to comment, answer, or start new threads.
