# Settings

The course itself will be generated by the platform administrator. You then will have to complete a few settings. Platform and course administrators can edit the course settings under the Course Administration menu.

#### Title
You can change the course title anytime you want. You should, however, stick to the chosen title as soon as the course has been published or announced.

#### Course Code
The course code will be visible to the participants in the course's URL.
Apart from that it only serves for internal purposes and **cannot** be changed anymore later on as some features rely on it, for instance the automatic filtering of the course videos for the video item dropdown.

#### Content language
Within the course list, the course could be also filtered by the chosen course language.

#### External course URL
Usually you just should keep it as it is. The platform team will make the correct settings. This is only for cross-promoting courses from sister-platforms such as *openHPI* or *openSAP*.

#### Abstract

The abstract is shown on the course list, title page, and the user's dashboard.	
It will include: 	
  - a brief information about the course schedule, 	
  - the language of the course, 	
  - the duration, 	
  - and a link to either enrol/un-enrol or enter the course.	

#### Description
The description shows the course content, learning objectives and target audience in more detail. 	
It should include:	
  - a brief summary of the course,	
  - the goal of the course along with an explanation about how it can be applied later,	
  - the structure of the course, explaining briefly about each week's expectation,	
  - the target audience and workload, including the time required to finish the course.	
  - short details about the course instructor,	
  - exam & certification details along with requirements for achievement.

#### Image
The course image is shown in the course list and course details view. Please add an image, which is related to the content. 
Ideally, the image is free of copyrights, alternatively images under a Creative Commons license or stock photos from commercial providers can be used. In these cases the license has to be provided in the course description.

#### Teaser video
A short teaser video (maximum 90 seconds) is required to be published a month prior to releasing the course. The video needs to highlight important information about the course and to motivate interested participants to enrol.

## Teachers

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/781737245?h=b2ee4125d3&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="openHPI-guidelines-04-cp-teachers"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

This is only for display reasons and does not provide any rights to the users that are added here. Only users that have been promoted to teachers beforehand can be added here. 

Please contact a platform administrator to promote a user to a teacher.

If a large amount of teachers will be conducting the course, you can provide an alternative teacher text, which will be shown instead of an extensively long list of teachers. Therefore you have to click on the "Advanced Settings" button to expand the alternative teacher text option.

## Categorization

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/781740042?h=227bbfc0e7&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="openHPI-guidelines-05-cp-categorization"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

The categorization feature has been implemented in the platform to enhance course management and provide course administrators with an efficient way to filter courses based on pre-defined categories. These categories have been set by the platform administrators to ensure consistency and ease of use. However, if there is a need to create new categories, course administrators can reach out to the platform administrators for assistance. By utilizing the drop-down menus, administrators can quickly assign relevant categories to courses, making it easier for learners to navigate and discover courses based on their specific interests and preferences.

#### Topic
Topics are defined per platform (talk to your platform administrator if you do not find a topic that suits you). Topics are used to filter the courses on the course list. On openHPI, for example, the topics are: Big Data and AI, Cloud and Operating Systems, Cybersecurity, etc. On your platform there might be different topics. Platforms running behind a portal, such as eGov-Campus or KI-Campus do not have a course list. The topic is therefore not reflected in the UI. Setting a topic might be useful for reporting purposes, so you can ask the platform administrator to do so if needed.

#### Reporting Type
Reporting types are only used for reporting purposes. The platform administrator can define a new reporting type. E.g. if you want to receive a combined course report for all the Java courses you offered in 2022, you could request to create a reporting type HPI-Java-2022 and use this for all Java courses of your institution offered on the platform in 2022.

#### Course List
It is possible to filter the courses according to a specific list that has been previously defined by the platform administrator. Talk to the platform administrator if the need comes to create lists.

#### Level
Like topics, levels are a way to filter courses on the courses page. They are predefined per platform. For example, on openHPI we use Junior, Beginner, Advanced and Expert.

#### Learning goals
The Learning goals are typically displayed to show learners the specific learning outcomes they can achieve through the course. These goals can vary depending on the course and can be created in this section. They also can serve as tags asigned to each course, which later on will allow for sorting and searching within the course database.

#### Target groups
These are the specific profiles of learners that the course is designed for. These groups can vary depending on the course and can be created in this section. They also can serve as tags asigned to each course, which later on will allow for sorting and searching within the course database.

#### Channel
If you want to publish your course in a dedicated channel, you can select the channel here by using the dropdown.

#### Advanced settings
In the advanced setting you can find also the option to highlight the course on the channel stage, selecting the status "Show on stage". Choosing this, it is mandatory to add a stage visual and a statement.

## Runtime and visibility

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/781797194?h=2c375b8a8e&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="openHPI-guidelines-06-cp-runtime"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Your course will be classified by two characteristics within the course list: Status and Course Language. 

#### Status
The status describes, which mode your course is currently in. You can choose between the following:

- **Preparation:** Use this while you're preparing the course. In this state the course is not visible to regular users; only to admins, teaching team members and teachers of the course.
- **Active:** This is the setting to be chosen while the course is running. It can be set anytime before the start of the course, as soon as you want your users to see it. It does not necessarily have to be completed. As long as there is no content available, users will only be able to access the course's details page. Please make sure to have completed the settings as described here before activating the course.
- **Archive:** When the course is finished it will automatically fall into archive mode. 

#### Auto archive after course end
Leave the setting as it is if you do not know exactly what you're doing

#### Course is hidden
You can use this setting to hide a course from the course list. Can be used for old iterations of a course to keep the course list tidy, or for experiments. The course is completely functionable and accessible for whoever knows the direct URL.

#### Show on course list
When disabled, the course will not show up on the global course list. It will, however, still be listed on its channel's landing page.

#### Restricted to groups
If your platform supports single sign-on with your company or ID provider, you have the option to restrict course enrollment exclusively to affiliated users. This means that only individuals associated with your organization or ID provider will be able to enroll in the course, ensuring that it remains accessible to the intended audience.

#### Start date (UTC)
The "actual" start date of the course.

#### Displayed start date
The "official" start date of the course. If set, it allows to make some part of the contents available as a preview.

#### End date
The end date of the course.

## Features

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/781744748?h=5d9a10120b&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="openHPI-guidelines-08-cp-features"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

This section allows to enable or disable platform features for a specific course. 

#### Overview
Show an overview of all published course content in the learning area.
The syllabus page (listing of all the course contents) can turned on and off. The default value for this feature is "enabled".

#### Video / audio download
All video or audio sequence can be downloaded by the participants if wished. This enables the participants to learn, for example, when no access to the internet is possible.
All video or audio files can be downloaded by the participants on a video item page, if desired. This enables the participants to learn, for example, when no access to the internet is possible. The default value for this feature is "enabled".

#### Collab spaces
Collab spaces offer smaller groups within a course the possibility to work together or to communicate without the whole course population knowing their shared information. Every course participant is able to create a collab space. All course participants can enter an open collab space. With a closed collab space, participants need to first apply for member- ship to gain entry. Collab spaces are enabled for all courses by default.

#### Discussion forum:
The discussion forum can be completely disabled for a course. In this case, there will be no links to the discussions in the course navigation or in the left-hand section navigation. Also, the forum cannot be accessed via deep link. Discussion forums in collab spaces are not affected by this toggle. Discussions are enabled for all courses by default.

<br>

## Certificates

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/781783272?h=58fb2d0c87&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479/embed" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></div>

For completing the course, participants could get the opportunity to receive a certificate. There are three certificate options:

#### Confirmation of Participation
You are eligible for a Confirmation of Participation if you have visited at least 50 percent of the course material. The Confirmation of Participation contains the following information: Name of participant, date of birth (optional), course title and summary

#### Record of Achievement
You are eligible for a Record of Achievement if you have earned more than 50 percent of the available points in the weekly assignments and the final exam. The Record of Achievement contains the following information:

* Participant's name
* Date of birth (optional)
* Course title and summary
* Credits earned
* Course performance (if you're among the top 5%, 10%, or 20% of participants)
* Anti-counterfeit link and QR code

#### Certificate (Proctoring)
A Qualified Certificate contains the participant’s photo and a supplement with detailed course information. The participant agrees to be proctored via webcam during the graded exercises and exams. With the help of this online proctoring technology, we determine that the registered user is taking the assignments and the final exam in person.

Besides the photo, the Qualified Certificate contains the following information:

* Participant's name
* Date of birth (optional)
* Course title and summary
* Credits earned
* Course performance (information about whether the participant is part of the best 5%, 10% or 20% of all participants)

* Anti-counterfeit link and QR code  

#### Reactivation
Allows achieving a RoA after regular course runtime (when graded assignments are locked). Learners have to book this feature by redeeming a voucher.

<br>

## Statistics

#### Auto-calculate course middle
The course middle is a metric used by the platform to calculate the students' attendance and completion rate of the course. When the Auto-calculate course middle option is set on the course middle will be calculated automatically between start and end of the course. As an example, it is suggested to choose this option for normal six weeks course.

#### Course middle for stats (UTC)
If you choose to disable the Auto-calculate course middle feature, you can set your own date here. This option is useful in cases where deadlines can be set after the end of the course, for example in a short two week course.

#### Rating (average stars)
This is a normal text input field where the results of a quiz designed for the students to evaluate the course can be added manually. After having performed the quiz, you can calculate the average results and enter the number here.

#### Rating (number of votes)
This is a normal text input field where the results of a quiz designed for the students to evaluate the course can be added manually. After having performed the quiz, you can enter the number of students who voted here.

#### Release records
As soon as your records (record of achievement, confirmation of participation) are ready to be released, turn this on.
*Prerequisites:*

- Record templates have been added (see [here](todo://link)).
- Statistics have been generated (see below).

#### Lock forum
If you want to lock the forum when the course goes to archive mode, you can set that here. In general, we recommend to do that if no one is keeping an eye on the forum anymore.

#### Generate Ranking
As soon as all deadlines have passed and all re-gradings have been done, press this button. You will receive an (in-platform) notification when it's done (takes some seconds). This button calculates only the value for *top X* for each user. This, in general, is required before the certificates can be released.
