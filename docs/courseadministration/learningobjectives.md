# Learning Objectives  

This is a new feature that openHPI team is currently working on to implement.  
The feature will allow the participants to set their preferred learning objectives and plan accordingly for an enrolled course.  
At the moment, the feature is in beta and has only been activated for selected courses on the openHPI platform. 
Setting a personal learning objective is optional. Participants can skip this step if they are not interested.

When activated, the learning objective option can be accessed from the course's **`Progress`** page as shown below:
