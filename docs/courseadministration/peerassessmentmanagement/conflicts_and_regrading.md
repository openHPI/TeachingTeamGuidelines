# Peer Assessment Conflicts & Regrading

If any reviewer reports a complaint against the reviewed participant, you can manage the details and resolve the conflict by following the illustration:

*Fig. In the same page down below, the teaching team can add a note and in some cases adjust the grade to close the conflict.*

If you choose to check the **Delta is absolute** box -  
* The grade will be set to a fixed amount of points
* Reviewer median and bonus points will be ignored  

If you choose to set a delta value, the points will be applied on top of the overall grade.  

# Regrading  

Teaching staff have the option to request for regrading any participant's peer assessment in either the **Conflict Reconciliation** page or the **Peer Assessment Submission** page.  

As the former is already described above, the following illustration will show the latter.
