# Additional Attempts

----------
Usually, learners have exactly one attempt for the graded assignments. However, sometimes the teaching team might want to give another attempt to someone. Please be aware that you can only add an additional attempt to someone as long as the deadline for this assignment has not passed, yet.

### Does a snapshot exist?
Sometimes the system provides a snapshot of the user's last entry (even if he has not submitted). If so, try to convert the snapshot and have a look if this already solves the problem. If not, take the following steps:

### How to add an additional attempt
- Go to the student enrollment list and search for the user who needs an additional attempt.
- Click on "submissions". You now see an overview of all submissions of this user. You can see if the participant has any remaining attempts.
- Select the assignment for which you want to grant another attempt and click on "add attempt".
- You will immediately see that an attempt was added. Now you can inform the user that he can try again.
