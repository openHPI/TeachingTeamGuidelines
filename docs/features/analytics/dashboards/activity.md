On this page the statistics of active users for a particular course is visualized on an hourly basis per day.  

From the following image, we can see how many users were active on a given day at a given time. The status of the users are colour-coded for easy visualization. If the shade of the colour is very light, we can understand that the number of users are low on that particular time and day. If the colour-code is darker in shade (close to dark red/maroon), the concentration of active users are high.
