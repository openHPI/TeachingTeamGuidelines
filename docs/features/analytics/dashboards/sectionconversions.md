This feature is currently under beta version which shows the conversion percentage of users from one section to another. As shown in the image below, the percentage expresses the number of items viewed. The users are then divided into these cohorts. The number of users is therefore relatively the height of the bar. We can evaluate the transition of user density and percentage of items they visited in both sections for a specific course. Here, number of modules represent the number of sections.
