# Forum moderation

The forum moderation feature ensures a respectful and safe learning environment for all participants. If a comment receives three or more reports from either students or teachers, it will be automatically blocked from public view. As a course administrator, you have the authority to block a comment based on just one report if you deem it necessary. In cases where a comment has accumulated three reports, you can personally review it and have the option to unblock it if you determine that it complies with the platform guidelines. Reporting a comment indicates that users find the post inappropriate or unsuitable for the forum's purpose, allowing for prompt action to maintain a constructive and inclusive discussion space.
