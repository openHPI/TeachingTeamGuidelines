# Platform

The **MOOC** (Massive Open Online Courses) format for digital education and digital awareness that has proven very successful in recent years. Besides being instrumental in the dissemination of learning content, primarily through videos, MOOCs are characterized by a high level of activity among participants.  

## This quality is supported by the following course features:
* Ease of access: Participation is free of charge. There are no entrance restrictions. 
* Large number of participants: Usually several thousand participants enroll in a course. 
* Event character: Courses are only offered in certain timeframes (start date, end date, test deadlines)  
* Guided course progress through the targeted publication of specific course contents by the teaching team at set times throughout the course (as a rule at the beginning of a new week).  

Since 2012 the research group “Learning and Knowledge Engineering,” at Hasso Plattner Institute, has been developing and operating its own MOOC platform. The HPI MOOC platform has been optimized for these type of courses. Guaranteeing high scalability has always been one of the main principles in the development of program functions.  

This distinguishes the platform from traditional e-learning offers, which often just work with a smaller number of participants.  

In addition, the MOOC platform is also very modular and highly configurable. The previously mentioned points are therefore not mandatory for a successful course.  

To date there have been four nearly identical instances of the HPI MOOC platform operating on the same technical infrastructure (private cloud):  

* **openHPI**: Europe‘s first MOOC platform. In September 2012, the platform was launched with Prof. Hasso Plattner’s course “In-Memory Data Management.” The contents of HPI’s English and German MOOCs are created by the institute’s own professors and the scientific staff at HPI. 

* **openSAP**: The first enterprise MOOC platform worldwide. Since May 2013, SAP has been providing online courses for professionals via its own platform. These courses are primarily on SAP software topics. Participation is also free of charge and open to everyone.

* **mooc.house**: The white label platform for businesses, organizations and individuals. Here everyone, who wants to disseminate interesting learning offers can become a course provider themselves and rely on the proven platform infrastructure. Among others, the Charité Berlin offers courses at mooc.house, but also the National Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech) has its own channel there.

* **OpenWHO**: The platform of the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO uses the platform to inform and train its staff, the on-site medical teams, and the affected population in the event of the outbreak of an epidemic.  

* The platform is also used as the e-learning component in the research projects AI-Campus and eGov-Campus.

The platform is multilingual and currently supports the following languages (as of Sept. 2020): 

* English 
* German 
* French 
* Chinese 
* Portuguese
* Russian
* Spanish

Other languages can be provided on request.  

Together with its partners, the Hasso Plattner Institute team investigates research questions and is constantly at work developing the platform. The dual role as platform provider, on one hand, and course provider, on the other hand, makes HPI a competent advisor, regardless of whether the issue concerns the optimal creation of a course or hosting questions.
