The categorization feature within the platform serves as a valuable tool for optimizing course management and streamlining the administrative tasks for course administrators. By implementing this feature, it becomes easier to classify and organize courses into specific categories, providing a systematic framework for efficient course filtering.

Initially, the platform has established a set of main categories to offer a foundation for course classification. However, the flexibility of the platform allows administrators to tailor these categories according to their specific needs and preferences. This includes the ability to edit and refine the existing categories, as well as manage the tags associated with each category. Through these customizable options, platform administrators can fine-tune the categorization system to align with the unique context and requirements of their platform.
